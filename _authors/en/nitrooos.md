# Hi! Iâ€™m Nitrooos.

From almost 5 years I have worked on creating websites and internet applications.
Usually as a Do-everything-man who can write a sensible frontend in
Angular/Vue.js/React, create a backend code logic in Python, adjust the database
structure or clean smelling code and pack it inside elegant containers.
Beside that, what's most important, remembers to move a proper ticket in Jira ;)

# Experience

My project work consists of:

* developing and maintaining the application which makes it possible to sell
tickets on theater events, cooperating with one of the biggest aviation brands
* rewriting the application in which you can create a financing quotation for
laser metalworking machine
* rewriting the whole view layer of application enabling user to create a
financing quotation for many different investment types for one of the biggest
players in banking sector
* creating from scratch a set of desktop applications in OpenFin environment,
one communicating with each other, for a big trading company

Currently I'm a Senior Fullstack Superhero keeping an eye on code cleaningness

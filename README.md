# Nitrooos's personal blog

This is a repo of my personal blog, currently available under
[nitrooos.pl](https://nitrooos.pl/).

## The content

For now, almost everything on this site are posts about programming, both frontend and backend related topics. Even some Dev Ops and security content can be found there. But, in the future there may be some posts about math, astrophysics or any other topic in my field of interests :) The blog has been actively developed since the March 2019.

## Technologies

Written with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted with the help of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). As a result the blog is entirely static website, and, more important, loads very quickly even on mobile internet connection.

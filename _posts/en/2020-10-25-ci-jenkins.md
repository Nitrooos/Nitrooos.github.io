  "How to integrate continuous integration (CI) into your application? Today 
  I'll show you how to automatically run your tests in Jenkins every time
  someone push new changes to the respository."

Continuous integration is a process which makes sure every new change 
introduced into the repository doesn't break the functionality nor integrity
of the app. It automates different steps ensuring that integrity, the most
often are:

- running app's tests (unit, integration, end-to-end etc.) with every new change
pushed into code repository
- trying to build an application with proposed changes
- updating technical documentation, if exists

Today's post describes how to start with continuous integration in your 
project by using a popular CI server, which is
[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/){:target="_blank"}.

## Continuous integration based on a project from Bitbucket

We'll start with creating new project on Jenkins, in which we'll configure
running applications tests automatically. We assume the code is hosted on
Bitbucket.

### Creating new Jenkins job

To create new job in Jenkins we need to click "New project" in the left
panel:

![
  Available actions in Jenkins admin panel
]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2019-07-17/step_1.png)
*Left side panel of Jenkins*

We'll be moved to new screen, where we can enter the name (in this case 
"awesome-app-ci"). We choose "General project" and click "OK":

*The view of creating new job in Jenkins*

As a result, on the main page of Jenkins we'll see our new job created:

![
  List of jobs with the newly created one
]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2019-07-17/step_3.png)
*List of jobs with the newly created "awesome-app-ci"*

Then we click the job's name and move to the edit view. On the left side
there are few options to manage it, among others the one allowing to
define what it should actually do. So we click the gear icon "Configure". We
can configure few aspects of the job, let's start with:

### General settings

There we enter a simple description. The example is about a Bitbucket 
repository, so we keep "Github project" checkbox unselected. It's
worth to check "Discard Old Builds". It means we won't store the logs and other
data about builds (so the runs of the job) older than X days or there won't
be more than Y old builds stored. This way we can save the disk space, not
filling it with (probably) not important data about builds from the past. An
interesting option in this section is also "This project is parameterized",
which is useful in e.g. jobs deploying changes to server. In such cases user
often want to choose which commit, tag or branch should be deployed before the
job starts. Here we keep this option not selected.

### Pointing the code repository

The next step is to enter the URL of the repository we want to integrate. In
this example we use "repositoryOwner" and "repositoryName" variables, which
comes from the next section. So as a result, we get a URL synchronized with the
values we enter for "repositoryOwner" and "repositoryName" variables. It's also
required to add the key pair ("Credentials"), which we need to create and name
earlier. One of the keys (private) is visible and stored only on Jenkins, the
second one (public) has to be added as a "Read access key" in proper service (in
this case Bitbucket). As a "Branch specifier" we enter a **/${sourceBranch}*
value. The *sourceBranch* variable (the branch we want to start Jenkins job on)
is given to us automatically by the
[Bitbucket Pull Request Builder](https://github.com/jenkinsci/bitbucket-pullrequest-builder-plugin#readme){:target="_blank"}
plugin, which we use in this setup.

### Bitbucket access and build settings

In this section we have the most information to complete. We start with 
selecting "Bitbucket Pull Requests Builder" option â€“ as I wrote earlier, we 
want to use this plugin. In the "Cron" field we enter `"* * * * *"` value, 
which means, Jenkins will check out repo every minute whether there are some
changes requiring the job to be run. The next important fields are "Bitbucket
BasicAuth Username" and "Bitbucket BasicAuth Password", so the name and 
password of the Bitbucketâ€™s user. It's best to create a new, dedicated user to
trigger the job (in this case with the jenkins@awesome-company.com email) and 
to give him access to the repo. In the "RepositoryOwner" field we enter the
organization/user owning the repo. "RepositoryName" requires us to input the
repository's name. In the "CI Identifier" field we enter an *unique* name among
all the Jenkin's jobs regarding that repository - the best is to add a short
description what Jenkins does in this job for this repository.

An interesting option here is to set "Comment phrase to trigger build". It 
makes possible to trigger the Jenkins job manually by simply entering a proper
comment in pull request. For example, it's sufficient to gladly ask Jenkins to run
the tests again (so to add a "test this please" comment) in pull request, and
Jenkins will trigger proper job automatically ðŸ™‚

### Build environment

Let's notice the "Delete workspace before build starts" option here, so the 
possibility to automatically clean the workspace (the disk space where the job 
will execute) before it starts. (The workspace is in practice a dedicated 
folder on the server, where the job execution taskes place). It allows to start
the job always from the exactly same, clean state. As a result, the jobs' runs
are more deterministic, because they don't depend on local workspace state. On
the other hand, we could click "Advanced" and control what exactly should be
cleared, and what not. For example, like on the screenshot attached below, we 
can clean the workspace for each task, but without the *node_modules* directory.
Such solution can make the builds faster, because they won't need to download and
install all project's dependencies for each build with *npm*.

### Build

This section allows us to define proper steps for the job to execute (basically
the script to run). For example, if our project is a standard Django app, then
we probably want to:

- create a new, local, virtual Python environment (using e.g. *virtualenv*)
- activate that environment
- install all needed packages by *pip* (and possibly also those required by 
*npm*)
- run the tests with proper settings

And this is exactly what does this small script below:

]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2019-07-17/step_8_build.png)
*'Build' section view of job configuration*

Additionally, there is a "Post-build Actions" section, where we can define what
Jenkins needs to do after finishing the job execution. A frequent example is
sending an email to some person(s) in the case of job failure. There exists 
also an option to send a separate mail to the person who introduced the error.

## Continuous integration for GitHub project

The configuration here is mostly analogous, but I'll inform you about few 
places where it differs, so you won't have problems also with GitHub projects
ðŸ™‚

In order to "bind" the code repository from GitHub to Jenkins job, I propose to
use
<a
  href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/ghprb-plugin"
  target="_blank">
  GitHub Pull Request Builder
</a>
plugin, similar to the one for Bitbucket. We need to start with plugin 
configuration. You can do it by entering the "Manage Jenkins" section (visible
on the left side panel), and then the "Configure System". In the section
"GitHub Pull Request Builder" please find the "GitHub Server API URL" field and
enter *https://api.github.com* value (or any proper one ;). Next, you should 
click "Add" near to the "Credentials" field and create the new credentials of 
type "User and password". Here, enter the username and password to the GitHub
account. A good practice is to create a new, dedicated GitHub account, only for
Jenkins and adding it as a "Collaborator" to our repository. We don't want to
to use our private accounts, right?

Then, we can configure new Jenkins job â€“ it's analogous to the Bitbucket 
example, except few differences:

- in the "General" section we should choose "GitHub project" and enter URL for
our GitHub project
- as a "Branch specifier" in the Source Code Management" we should use 
*${sha1}* â€“ as the plugin's documentation suggests
- in the "Build Triggers" section choose "GitHub Pull Request Builder" and 
select the credentials created before
- (recommended) select an option "Use github hooks for build triggering", so
Jenkins will wait for an information from GitHub about the need to run the job
(omitting this mean Jenkins will use polling to get such information from 
GitHub after every period of time, e.g. one minute)

## The summary

As I've shown in this post, implementation of continuous integration doesn't 
need to be hard and time-consuming, at least in such basic scope. Nevertheless,
we need to remember it doesn't fit well with every project. For example, when
it doesn't include tests, automatically generated documentation or cannot be 
built with every change, then implementing CI will be impossible or
pointless. The conclusion is then: your product needs to be prepared for it. The
process of implementing it, when you use one of available, dedicated solutions
(which without a doubt Jenkins is) will be fairly straightforward ðŸ™‚

#### TL;DR

Jenkins makes it possible to "bind" the code repository from GitHub or 
Bitbucket. Every pull request can be tracked by it, triggering the job(s) 
specified by our scripts when any new change will appear. It can run the test
suite for our application, try to build it, generate an updated documention etc.

# Privacy policy

## Information collection and use

The website nitrooos.pl does not collect nor use any personal information.

## Log data

## Cookies

As long as you don't comment any post on nitrooos.pl, you don't have any 
cookies set by our website nor third-party services. But we use an external
service [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/){:target="_blank"} to provide 
comments functionality on the page. It requires you to sign in to
[github](http://github.com/){:target="_blank"} to comment a post, thus 
Utterances sets a cookie to store the github api token. It's the only cookie
stored on user's device when browsing nitrooos.pl. Please notice you don't have
it until you comment a post and it's necessary to provide you the possibility to
comment.
